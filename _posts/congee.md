This congee recipe is based on my and Sherilyn's family recipes, adjusted over the years to suit our tastes. It's a mix of Taiwanese and and Chinese traditions for congee, built on a foundation of strong umami with fried shallots, groud pork shoulder, preserved egg, and chicken broth, and balanced with crisp and fragrant pickled mustard stem and optionally floral gamcai to round out the flavors with some acid and funk.

## Ingredients

* rice -  _1 cup_
* chicken broth or water with boullion - _5-9 cups_
* shallots - _2 small, or 1 large, sliced into crescents_
* green onion - _2, cut into rings_
* ground pork - _1/2 - 1 lb_
* vegetable oil - _1 tsp_
* salt - _to taste_
* light soy sauce - _1 tbsp (optional)_
* dark soy sauce - _1 tbsp (optional)_
* cooking wine - _2 tsp (optional)_
* black pepper - _1 tsp (optional)_
* preserved egg - _1 or 2, to taste (optional)_
* sesame seeds - _2 tsp (optional)_
* sesame oil - _1 tsp (optional)_
* chili oil - _2 tsp (optional)_
* fermented black beans - _1 tsp (optional)_

## Recipe

1. Add 1 part frozen rice to 5-9 parts chicken broth and/or water with boullion, to taste. Bring up to a bare simmer (there should be few bubbles) and cook for 20 minutes. If you forget to freeze the rice, simmering for 90 minutes works too.
2. While rice is cooking, add pork to a pan without oil, add soy sauce (or salt, if you don't have soy sauce), and cook until brown on both sides.
> _Optionally, marinade the pork ahead of time by adding cooking wine, dark soy, and light soy, stirring it, and letting it sit covered in the fridge for 30 minutes._

> _Also, you can fry the shallots first until golden brown, remove, then cook the pork in the shallot oil._
3. Clear out a space center of pan for shallots. In the pork fat, fry the shallots until golden brown. Remove pork and shallots from oil when cooked through -- the timing may be different.
4. When rice is almost done, stir in pork, fried shallots, white part of yourÂ green onions, chopped preserved egg, chopped pickled mustard stem, and ginger. Only the ginger, green onion, and pork are important -- mix and match the rest.
5. Top with your choice of pickled mustard stem, green part of the green onion, sliced preserved egg, chili oil, sesame oil, and/or sesame seeds.

## Sourcing

### Rice

Rice is the bulk of your congee, and putting steamed rice in water does not taste good -- you want the stuff around the congee to have some flavor and texture too, which means that you need to a. use starchy rice, and b. get the starches out of the rice.

Starchy rices include almost all Asian varieties of rice. Sushi rice or sweet rice is usually okay. Avoid long grain rices like Basmati unless you're going for rice in water. To get starch out of your rice, either cook it for 90 minutes or break it up -- either with your favorite cooking instrument or rock or by freezing it with equal parts water.

### Broth or Water

Tap water works pretty well here. Chemically distilled water is frowned on for the same reason people don't like it in their coffee: it makes 
### Shallots

Shallots are 69 cents each at Ralphs, but $2 a pound at 99 Ranch or Asian supermarkets. Get them at Asian supermarkets if you can -- they're super versatile and elevate flavors for cheap.

### Ground Pork

You can get this either at Trader Joes or 99. If you go to 99, don't get the pre-ground pork. It's gross and it's been sitting there all day. Ask if they can grind up a piece of pork butt (it's pork shoulder).

### Preserved Egg

You want the one that's black colored, not the salted duck eggs.

### Chili Oil

Lao gan ma is always good -- you can search up pictures of the jar online.
## Aside

I generated the banner page with AI as I'd made 4 batches of congee recently to iterate on this recipe and was too burnt out to make a new one, and after eating congee for 5 meals straight Sherilyn had banned me from making congee as well for the next week. I will replace the banner photo if and when I get the chance.
